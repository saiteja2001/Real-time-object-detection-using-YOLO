 This Project can detect objects using the tiny-yolo model which one of the trained object detection model that is trained on large data. It can detect object in real time.
 we need to download the YOLOv3 cfg,weights and label files. I have uploaded in this drive link. https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1QliHVqoQDV2IT2F8HbpbefxyRTU4zT8R?usp=sharing
